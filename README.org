** Features
   - 60 keys arranged in a 6x10 matrix (uses 16 pins on the microcontroller).
   - Silkscreen has a qwerty layout with number keys arranged in a numpad.
   - Lead free ENIG-RoHs surface finish with 2oz copper.
   - SPI, I2C, and 2 additional GPIOs broken out.
   - Each pin along the edge of the Teensy is connected to one extra pin in the
     prototyping area.
   - Beginner friendly through hole soldering.
   - Example Arduino sketch [[https://github.com/AnthonyDiGirolamo/teensy-thumb-keyboard/tree/master/firmware][firmware]] provided. Additional details in the [[https://hackaday.io/project/162281-teensy-thumb-keyboard/log/156138-example-firmware-posted][Example
     Firmware Posted project log]].
   - Layout is completely customizable in the firmware.
   - [[https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware][qmk_firmware]] should also work however, I don't have an example running yet.

   *Three possible mounting options*

   1. Teensy on the front, mounted right-side up, with usb port facing north.
   2. Teensy on the back, mounted upside down, with usb port facing north or
      south.
   3. Teensy on the back, mounted upside down, with usb port facing south. Note:
      Breakout pins will only work as expected with USB facing north.

** Parts list for a fully working keyboard

   - 1x [[https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy32.html][Teensy 3.2]] or [[https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensylc.html][Teensy LC]]. A [[https://www.tindie.com/products/TleraCorp/butterfly-stm32l433-development-board/][Butterfly STM32L433]] will also work (though not
     as a USB keyboard).
   - 10x 1N4148 Zener Diodes
   - 60x Panasonic EVQ-PAC04M Tacticle Switches. These are the quieter and higher
     quality switches. Some are available at [[https://www.digikey.com/products/en?keywords=EVQ-PAC04M][digikey]]. If you wish to use the 3d
     printed faceplate the overall switch height must be 4.3mm. These models will
     also work: EVQ-PAD04M EVQ-PAE04M EVQ-PAG04M. Otherwise any standard 6x6mm
     momentary switch will work.

** Ordering

   - [[https://www.tindie.com/products/15575/][Teensy Thumb Keyboard - PCB only]] Tindie product page
   - Ordering yourself from a PCB manufacturer:
     - https://oshpark.com instructions: upload the [[https://github.com/AnthonyDiGirolamo/teensy-thumb-keyboard/blob/master/hardware/v1.1/teensythumbboard.kicad_pcb][kicad pcb file]] file.
     - https://jlcpcb.com/quote instructions: upload the [[https://github.com/AnthonyDiGirolamo/teensy-thumb-keyboard/blob/master/hardware/v1.1/plots/gerbers.zip][gerber.zip file]] The
       settings I'd recommend are:
       - Layers: 2
       - Thickness: 1
       - Surface finish: LeadFree HASL-RoHs or ENIG-RoHs (don't want lead on a
         board you may be typing on)
       - Copper weight: 2oz (1oz is probably fine though, the heavier weight
         copper stands up better to repeated solder and desoldering I think)
       - Everything else default settings.

** Cases

   - Keyboard Faceplate [[https://a360.co/2QAJ0Qb][Fusion 360 Public Link]]
   - Raspberry Pi 3 B+ & HyperPixel4 Handheld [[https://a360.co/2QzHvla][Fusion 360 Public Link]]

** Firmware

   - The layout for USB keyboarding is defined in the ~usb_key_matrix~ variable
     in [[https://github.com/AnthonyDiGirolamo/teensy-thumb-keyboard/blob/master/firmware/LayoutThumbKeyboard.h#L109][LayoutThumbKeyboard.h]]

   - If you don't need a USB keyboard and are rolling your own hardware project
     then you can focus on the layout defined by the ~ascii_key_matrix~ variable
     in [[https://github.com/AnthonyDiGirolamo/teensy-thumb-keyboard/blob/master/firmware/LayoutThumbKeyboard.h#L74][LayoutThumbKeyboard.h]]

   - There are three layers defined: base, shift, and Fn layers.

   - USB can be disabled by commenting out define ~USE_TEENSY_USB_KEYBOARD~.

   - All the keyboardy goodness is handled by the ~keyboard_update();~ function
     called from inside the standard Arduino ~loop()~.

   - If you don't need the keys to behave like a keyboard you can gut most of
     that example and just use ~key_matrix.update();~ The KeyboardMatrix class
     handles reading the button states.

   - An alternative firmware option for a pure USB keyboard would be to run the
     excellent https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware.
